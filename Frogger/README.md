HOW TO PLAY: Slimer Crossroad

Open index.html file to begin.

You'll start the game with 1 slimer character in the grass. You will have the option to move in four directions (left, right, up and down). Be careful not to collide with the Marsh-mellow man, your enemy, he's sneaky and quick like lightning. Get to the water as many times as you can. If you do have an encounter with your enemy, the game will rest you to the starting position. DONT GIVE UP! Try again, practice make perfect. Enjoy!
