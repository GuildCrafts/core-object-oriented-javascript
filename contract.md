# Core: Object Oriented Javascript

This goal requires an understanding of JavaScript syntax. Specifically, you should know how to write control structures, how to write simple functions, and recognize the different variable types in JavaScript. You should be able to read existing JavaScript code with these features and predict its outcome.

Take on this goal if you want to learn about:

- Scopes & Closures
- The Keyword "this"
- Prototype Delegation
- Code Reuse


## Day 1: Scopes & Closures

Your objectives for the day is to:

- Learn about JavaScriptâ€™s variable scoping, including lexical scopes and dynamics scopes.
